# DAND-P3-AB-Test-Analysis
Data Analyst Nano Degree's third project: Analyze A/B Test Results

This project was designed to setup a real-world example where I am a business analyst for a e-commerce company that wants
to launch a new landing page for their website. They want to know if this new landing page will have a better conversion 
rate than the old page. The goal of this project is to use the following procedures to answer this question:
* Hypothesis Testing
* A/B Testing
* Regression 
 
As a data analyst, one question that gets asked often is how will metric A affect the productivity of my workers.
The beauty of this project is that the procedures taught in it can be adjusted and applied to this question or virtually
any other data question that a business may have.
